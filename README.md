# RouteFinder

## What?

This project is based on the initial stages of Udacity's C++ Nanodegree, and implements the [A* search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) in C++.

## Why?

I wanted to practice skills gained in the initial stages of the course.

## What does it do?

Given an input grid, with defined "start" and "finish" sections, calculates the shortest path from start to finish, using the [A* search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm).

## What's theirs/mine?

Most of the code at [367f38d](https://github.com/thisisnic/RouteFinder/commit/367f38dcf398b43233326a463ddcfb1ee570c326) is provided by the course, though I did imlpement some of the methods there.  Any changes after that commit are mine.

## Why not just use the project from the course?

There is a first-module project which contains more complex code, but I was disappointed to find that its completion was fairly simple and mostly required filling in method usage in existing code rather than substantial independent components.  It also involves a custom fork of a mapping library which works well in Udacity-provided workspaces, but is difficult to install locally and poorly documented.
